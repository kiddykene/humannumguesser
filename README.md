#thanks for downloading, some brief things if you wanna further tweak this project:
#  the current winrate on the 907 standardized test is 11.246%
#  I did explain lots of the main system in my video (poorly ofc)
#  so I went through and added comments are certain bits to hopefully catch you up
#  if somehow after working on this project you manage to improve the winrate on the standardized 907 test, message me because
#  that's pretty interesting. Also try to be genuine with it because it is an incredibly easy thing to fake.
#  Make sure it's able to score the same wr consistently.
#change these variables to the path of the files
Ps. If you are running this program on GNU/Linux you need root, because python package `keyboard` require root.
