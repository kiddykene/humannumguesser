# thanks for downloading, some brief things if you wanna further tweak this project:

## winrate

the current winrate on the 907 standardized test is `11.246%`

## note

I did explain lots of the main system in my video (poorly ofc) so I went through and added comments are certain bits to hopefully catch you up if somehow after working on this project you manage to improve the winrate on the standardized 907 test, message me because that's pretty interesting. One thing that people get confused about is the dataset/firstdataset/seconddataset lists. The first and second datasets are essentially just coppies of the first and second key parts of each number in the dataset. For example note the first number in the dataset is 15, this means in parallel the first number in firstdataset is a 1, and in secondadaset it's a 5. The reason they're split like this is because when there's a 100 in the main dataset, there's a 10 in firstdataset, and a 0 in secondataset. This helps so It doesn't have to keep running the new numbers through the conversion process

also try to be genuine with it because it is an incredibly easy thing to fake. Make sure it's able to score the same wr consistently. change these variables to the path of the files

Package installation:

```bash
